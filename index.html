	<p>LinkNYC is a big deal. New York City's newest connectivity network, over 7,500 LinkNYC kiosks will be installed throughout the city, offering offering free internet, phone calls, and USB charging ports. If you live in New York, the nine foot tall kiosks are hard to miss. The project is a collaboration between the city Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet company, and is part of their goal of building a "smart city" that brings modern communication and technology to everyone. <p> <p>But just how accessible is it? A 2015 report by the NYC Bureau of Policy and Research found that around a quarter of NYC households don’t have broadband internet, hampering numerous aspects of their everyday life. However, only 700 of LinkNYC kiosks will be installed in the Bronx, where the highest percentage of households without broadband are concentrated. Additionally, some of these kiosks have limited internet usage. Some offer full time free wifi, while others only offer three 30 minute “free” sessions, and others even less, according to data obtained through New York City Open Data. </p>

			<p>According to the New York Daily News, Manhattan will have the greatest number of kiosks and the fastest internet speeds. Meanwhile, they found the LinkNYC network will operate more slowly on average in poorer neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx, though the mayor's office said variations in speed is only temporary. <p> <p>“LinkNYC is a promising program, but it can’t hope to achieve its goals unless equal considerations are made for people in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island as those in Manhattan,” says the Jen Lynch, Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world. “Having disparate levels of connectivity and access, without clearly communicating that, will cause people to rely on the system, only to have it cut out from under them by limited use tiers when they may need it most, such as when completing a job application or during a Skype interview.”<p> <p>The city says these issues will be remedied but it’s unclear how long doing so will take, and for residents this impacts, that is of little comfort. </p>
